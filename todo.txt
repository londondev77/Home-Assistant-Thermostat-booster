Done but needs testing
1.	Test when time reaches 0.
2.	Test with multiple thermostats – seems to work
3.	To aid testing, change time duration range to 0 to 60 mins with step 1 temporarily 
4.	Remove debug – to be tested
5.	Hide both sliders when boost is active
6.	Remove clicking on entity name – prob not needed
7.	Remove boost timer entity
8.	Boost finish is unknown when boost isn’t active. Can it be nicer?
9.	Add schedules
10.	Ensure scheduler and scheduler card are added by thermostat
11.	Start boost  turn off all schedules
12.	End boost  turn on all schedules
13.	Take state of schedules
14.	Rather than turn on all schedules, restore scene
15.	Add preset dropdowns
16.	Start building up card using bubbles
17.	Get the countdown working properly on the summary card
18.	Reinstate 0 to 24 hours step 0.5
19.	Add units to sliders
22.	Check services – what has been created? Can we integrate timer services overall or at least hide them?

To do
Test:
1a - does the scene restore when the boost continues past a reboot
1b - get the end boost to trigger correctly if it expires on reboot.  Ensure scene gets triggered too
19a. Ensure thermostat is switched on. Maybe when adding integration?
22. Add icon for integration
23.	All rooms boost
24.	Make the temperature slider dynamic by taking the min and max settings from the thermostat?
25. Dependencies on adding integration

Don't think needed:
20.	Countdown go blue - it's because it needs to be made active if boost is active. As it's not a timer anymore, it isn't active.
